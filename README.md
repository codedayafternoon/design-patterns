# Design Patterns implementation examples

The project includes examples for many design patterns.
Each Design Pattern is a separate project called from the main project 'DesignPatterns'. In the latter, there is a folder for each design pattern project, which works as a composition root for the corresponding example.

Reviews, corrections and suggestions are welcome!
